                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><em>I was born in South Africa, and moved to Germany in 2014. Being a free spirit, I have always been totally addicted to the thrill of creating. Naturally art was picked as a subject at school, and for the final examination I was nominated for a distinction by our art teacher - but unfortunately didn’t make it. Then I enrolled for a Bachelors degree in Fine art at University. After completing the first year I switched my studies to fashion designing, and received a diploma at the end of the studies. I started working as designer in a Bridal boutique and owned my own fashion boutique 5 years later. I always took big mental leaps and started new things, so that was just a beginning of my career.
<br>
<br>My approach to art is similar. As a result ‘diverse’ is a good description for my art as a whole. The main objective is to create something that portrays a mood or character, or express how I feel about the subject. It can be anything from portraits, cityscapes, wild life, flowers as well as the abstract. The subject matter of each piece of work spontaneously determines the materials and the style. However it is always important that whatever I do makes sense in some way. To me painting is therapeutic, similar to meditation, being my way to find inner peace.
<br>
<br>My style is mostly impressionistic, however lately has been adapted to surrealism,  a painting technique that allows the unconscious to express itself. The abstract work is normally a planned composition that is rational and calm, with the excitement coming from the tension set up between the colours and shapes. I also experiment with different techniques using brushes, palette knifes, sponges and even my fingers. In addition to oil, acrylic or waterpaint, I also like to incorporate other mediums such as structure paste, gold leaf, and collage items especially for my abstract work.
<br>
<br>I would like to expand on the experience of painting stories and incorporating emotion into my work.&nbsp;</em><br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">In her oeuvre of recent work, visual artist Mica Leiner, explores the full range of figurative art making. There are several distinct stylistic categories that showcase her unique and diverse style. The range of her visual interpretation includes a personal adaptation of impressionism, atmospheric expressionism and a strong tendency toward abstraction which is particularly evident in the colourful cityscapes and flower studies.
<br>
<br>The series of iconic portraits reveals a fine sense of observation and portrayal of character, manifesting in a coherent study of personality. These aspects come to the fore successfully in the portraits of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi.
<br>
<br>The abstractions reminds one of the contrasting chromatic scale present in the Constructivists and the later 20th century colour Field painters of the USA.
<br>
<br>This selection of work illustrates a talented artist with a personal point of departure and skillful technical ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7"><em>I have admired Marica’s ability to paint, draw and be in command of shape, structure, colour and technique for many years. She was born to be creative and has always produced work of a very high appealing and aesthetic level. The words of Henri Matisse sum her work and approach up quite well “An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of style, prisoner of repudiation, prisoner of success, etc.”
<br>A feeling of emptiness and quietness repeats itself in a number of the artist’s works. The deserted stranded ‘Fishing Boats on shore’ is the best example. The bareness, tranquil and mysterious atmosphere is captivating, almost alluring and enigmatic. Her sensitive brushwork enhances the somber mood of the painting.
<br>I find the reclining nude ‘Reminiscent’ the most sensual piece. It reminds me of Modigliani’s calm controlling shapes and surfaces, and the simplicity of masterpieces of Matisse’s nudes. Some of her abstract paintings are in direct contrast to this quietness. The movement they capture and radiate is both confusing and energetic.
<br>The portrait paintings reflect the nobility and dignity of her subjects as well as capture their character. Both Gandhi and Mandela would be proud of her interpretations as it does them great justice in many ways
<br>Instead of confronting us, her work creates synergy and leaves us with a sense of completeness. As Pablo Picasso said, ‘The purpose of art is to wash the dust of daily life off our souls.’ The chief enemy of creativity is 'good' sense. Her work does that, and is timeless - very few artists achieve that in their lifetime.&nbsp;</em></p>
